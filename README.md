# Tic Tac Toe!

I created a Tic Tac Toe game with Next.js (TS).

All components in one file as I was asked to make something like this in a job interview, and wanted to reflect the layout I was given.

Initially, I was asked to do this in pure React, but as I am learning TypeScript and Next.js I decided it would be a good initial project. Which in essence is still the React solution, just with some type safety.

## Challenges:

- I hadn't worked with **Index Signatures** much in **Typescript**, so had to look up how to handle those. Was relatively straight forward after reading the documentation. I also found a nice youtube video on it: [Joy of Code YT Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG60E9XPru4)
