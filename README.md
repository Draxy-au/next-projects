# Static Site Rendering, Incremental Static Site Rendering, Server Side Rendering

Here I revisit an earlier app where I was fetching some dummy data and displaying it through means.
I originally did this app to try out dynamic routing, but will now suit the purpose of trying out various means of rendering pages statically, dynamically or a combination of both.

This should result in some pages being rendered at Build time and some being rendered on the client side.
I also want to see how incremental regeneration of pages goes, and try out some actual server side stuff.

I am also going to move the Dummy Data to Firebase (the realtime db so I can fetch from it as an api).
