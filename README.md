# API Routes

So building on the Events app I have been interating over as I learn Next, I am going to implement some API routes now.
Will add a comments section to events, that will use an API route to save a comment to a DB.
Will also add a newletter email sign up, which will also use an api route.

Not really worried about styling as this is more a learning exercise, but will try to make it look human readable heh

# Context

Adding a toast on the API stuff, which will show when things are pending, successful, or fail. But the purpose is more to do with using the app wide context.
Building on top of the standard React Context, this will just show it being used within a Next project.
