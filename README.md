# API Routes

So building on the Events app I have been interating over as I learn Next, I am going to implement some API routes now.
Will add a comments section to events, that will use an API route to save a comment to a DB.
Will also add a newletter email sign up, which will also use an api route.

Not really worried about styling as this is more a learning exercise, but will try to make it look human readable heh
